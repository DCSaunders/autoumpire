- Targetting graph initialise with players
- Targetting graph retargetting after a kill. Might need to add manual swapping if necessary.
- Add competence field and ability to update competence. Should include new colour for representation!
- Add wanted field and ability to make people wanted. Should include new colour for representation and should override the inco field.
- Link up mailer to send emails on update *if needed only*
- Options to make a police player/resurrect a police player with a rank/make a police player corrupt (same syntax as wantedness probably) at any point in game.
- Generate inco, wanted, police and corrupt/dead corrupt police lists.
- Could have some kind of alert for potential illicit kills (shouldn't automatically make wanted, could be case of bearing etc.)
- It might be worth making wantedness a thing in the short game, and just having it keep a bounty list. Would update templates automatically, which might be helpful.
