- Thorough retargetting testing.
- Add competence field and ability to update competence. Should include new colour for representation!
- Need command to set wantedness redemption condition
- Should have final command in game be current date/time, which determines current competence/wantedness state
- Need to make list of commands so far.
- Link up mailer to send emails on update *if needed only*
- Options to make a police player/resurrect a police player with a rank/make a police player corrupt (same syntax as wantedness probably) at any point in game.
- Generate inco, wanted, police and corrupt/dead corrupt police lists.
- Could have some kind of alert for potential illicit kills (shouldn't automatically make wanted, could be case of bearing etc.)
- It might be worth making wantedness a thing in the short game, and just having it keep a bounty list. Would update templates automatically, which might be helpful.
