**List of commands usable in the Autoumpire**

Commands are executed in order from top of file to bottom, one line at a time.
A new line starts after a linebreak, not after line wrapping.
Multiple commands may be chained on a given line using `ALSO`.
All commands on a given line take place simultaneously (allowing e.g. double kills.)
In each example, PlayerX indicates the player's full (signup) name.
